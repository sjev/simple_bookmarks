# Simple bookmark manager

I've got tired of managing bookmarks with a tool that just does not cut it.
So here is an idea:
- store the bookmarks in a plain yml file, under version control etc
- use python scripts to extract data and generate clickable html pages

the idea came from [buku](https://github.com/jarun/Buku) bookmark manager, only I wanted something that was way simpler.
